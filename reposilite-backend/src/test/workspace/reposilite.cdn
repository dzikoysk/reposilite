# Note: It might be hard to estimate the best amount of threads for your use case,
# but you can safely increase amount of threads if needed and Reposilite will create only as much as it needs.
# This option might be more useful to limit available memory resources to minimum (1 thread requires around 200kb to 1MB of memory)
