Host JavaDoc pages automatically using JAR files (`*-javadoc.jar`) located in repositories.
Javadoc file is extracted during the first request to `$working-directory/javadocs` directory.

To access javadocs, you have to visit `repo.domain.com/javadoc/<repository>/<gav>`. 
For instance, using Reposilite Javadocs:

* [reposilite repository / reposilite-3.0.2 javadocs](https://maven.reposilite.com/javadoc/releases/com/reposilite/reposilite/3.0.2/)
